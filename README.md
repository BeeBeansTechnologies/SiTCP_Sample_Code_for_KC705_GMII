# SiTCP Sample Code for KC705 GMII

This is the SiTCP sample source code (GMII version) for KC705 communication confirmation.

In this code use the module that converts the interface of AT93C46, used by SiTCP, to EEPROM (M24C08) of KC705.

This code also use a module that to operate I2C switch, PCA9548A, loaded on the KC705.

Before downloading the firmware to the KC705, please set the jumper connection of J29, J30, J64 of KC705 as follows.

* J29: Jumper over pins No.1-2.
* J30: Jumper over pins No.1-2.
* J64: No jumper.

(Please see at reference Xilinx UG 810 for more information).


## What is SiTCP

Simple TCP/IP implemented on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) for the purpose of transferring large amounts of data in physics experiments.
